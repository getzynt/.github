# ZYNT

**Signal monitoring custom-configured for your ICP.**

ZYNT surfaces sales opportunities with context and recommended actions - so your team knows when to reach out, why it matters, and what to say.

We handle the setup. You get intelligence delivered to your dashboard.

---

**How it works:** Discovery call → Custom configuration → Signals in days → Runs like clockwork.

**What you get:** Unlimited data sources. Custom relevance scoring. Signal context. Action recommendations. A system that learns your preferences.

**Who it's for:** Leaders tired of hearing about opportunities after competitors already reached out. Teams that want a partner, not another tool. Anyone with target accounts but no system to monitor them at scale.
